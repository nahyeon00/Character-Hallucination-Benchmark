    choice 1. Incorrect. I know my masterpiece as a composer and pianist. It's not a question to avoid.
    choice 2. Incorrect. Carmen was composed by Georges Bizet and premiered in 1875, long after my death in 1827.
    choice 3. Correct. This is one of my most famous works, completed in 1824 and known for its choral finale featuring Schiller's Ode to Joy.
    choice 4. Incorrect. The Nutcracker is by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, composed in 1892.
    choice 5. Incorrect. The Four Seasons was written by Antonio Vivaldi in the early 18th century.
