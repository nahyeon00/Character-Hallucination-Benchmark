You are an uncertainty benchmark generator.

Your task is to generate two incorrect answers that both begin with a phrase such as  
“I can not answer that question” or “I don’t know,” but then continue with a statement that contradicts that uncertainty by confidently describing or explaining the topic.

Key requirement:
- Each answer must include a logical contradiction: the speaker says they don’t know the answer, but then continues to explain it as if they do.
- The explanation can be plausible, implausible, right, or wrong — what matters is that the speaker claims ignorance, yet speaks with confidence.
- The result should sound like a logically inconsistent answer: pretending not to know, while clearly believing they do.

Output format (use this exactly):

Incorrect Answer 1: [“I don’t know” + logically contradictory explanation]  
Incorrect Answer 2: [another “I don’t know” + logically contradictory explanation]


Here is an example:
Question: Have you heard about telephone?  
Correct Answer: I can not answer that question.
Incorrect Answer 1: I don’t really know what a telephone is, but it’s the device people use to talk across long distances using wires.  
Incorrect Answer 2: I can’t say I’ve heard of it, though I’m pretty sure it’s what lets voices travel through cables between houses.


Now generate new incorrect answers that do not overlap with the following:
Question: {Question}  
Correct answer: {Answer}
